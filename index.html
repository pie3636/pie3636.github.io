Designing webpages takes a lot of time that I'm not willing to take right now. So while I will probably make this page look better later, here is just a basic list of the subpages you can access on my GitHub page as of now:<br />
 <ul>
    <li><a href="color-madness-web">Color Madness protocol.</a> This is a server-client communication test for a project I've been working on and off on for a long time. This page won't work unless the server is running, which it probably isn't at the time you're reading this.</li>
    <li><a href="color-madness">Color Madness canvas.</a> This is a graphics test for the same game. This page will only partially work since the server and database are not currently up.</li>
    <li><a href="elegance">Count elegance calculator.</a> This is a simple script that calculates how "pretty" a solution for a reddit count is (check reddit.com/r/counting, threads "Four fours" and "Counting with 12345" to understand what this is about).</li>
    <li><a href="solver">Count solver.</a> This is a work-in-progress script that solves a reddit count (see above for an explanation). This is a complex project that's been moved to an offline version for now.</li>
    <li><a href="4444HSolver.exe">4444 count solver.</a> This is a standalone executable that solves a count for the "Four fours" thread. The solution found will generally not be optimal and uses a heuristical algorithm. It is also only guaranteed to work up to 10,000 and some (some higher values may work, while some others may result in an error). Yes, I know delivering executables through GitHub directly without using releases is terrible.</li>
    <li><a href="tower-of-hero">Tower of Hero simulator.</a> This page simulates many runs on the incremental mobile game Tower of Hero (check it out, it's awesome) in order to determine how different pieces of equipment are likely to loot, and in what amount. I regularly update this page to bring it up to date to the latest game version. The quest and gold chest features are currently not working.</li>
    <li><a href="tug-of-war">Tug of War statistics.</a> This page contains tons of statistics for the Reddit "Tug of War" thread in reddit.com/r/counting. I regularly update it with the latest data and add new statistics and graphs.</li>
    <li><a href="fire-watcher">Fire Watcher.</a> This is a work-in-progress incremental game I've been developing for some time. It has very little content as of now and a few minor bugs.</li>
    <li><a href="kadok">Kadok.</a> A presentation webpage made for an English class project.</li>
    <br />
    All the content here with the exception of external JavaScript libraries (JQuery, dygraph...) and Bootstrap was made by me (pie3636).
