            <dt>How does it work?</dt>
            <dd>Regularly (usually when a get is reached), I fetch all the recent count data from Reddit using a small script that I wrote. After making sure everything is right, I then use another script to generate the statistics, that I simply paste into a file. This website then reads this data and displays the statistics in a more aesthetically pleasing way. If you want to see what the raw stat file looks like, take a look <a href="js/data.js">here</a>.</dd>
            <dt>What's next?</dt>
            <dd>I plan on adding more statistics. In particular, more user-based stats (who participated in most threads, etc). Since I already have the complete dataset, it is easy to generate those statistics.</dd>
            <dt>Is the data reliable?</dt>
            <dd>All the counts were gathered automatically, and then checked, so this isn't a source of error. However, some slight alterations had to be made to the data. For example, it sometimes happened that someone missed a count or counted twice the same number, and it wasn't always noticed by the users. I could unfortunately not leave that as is, due to how the scripts I'm using to generate statistics work, and I had to manually "fix" a few counts here and there, by changing a digit or sometimes adding or removing a count. This is why if you examine the data carefully, you will find a few discrepancies. I did my best to keep that editing to a minimum and to do it in the most coherent way possible, but if you notice that something looks wrong, feel free to message me and I will see if I can change it. For reference, I estimate about 0.2% of the data (500 counts) were altered this way.</dd>

            <h5>25 May 2019:</h5>
            - Added statistic: current positive/negative count streak<br />
            - Added statistic: current positive/negative get streak<br />
            - Added statistics for "get counts", meaning counts that reached a get<br />
            <hr/><h5>21 May 2019:</h5>
            - Two new charts are available at the bottom of the "Charts" tab: The first one shows how many counts were posted above or below each number. The second one shows how much time the count spent above or below each number<br />
            - Slight formatting and visual improvements<br />
            <hr/><h5>5 May 2019:</h5>
            - Charts are now dynamic! You can click and drag on them to zoom. A legend in the top right corner also gives you the exact values.<br />
            - Statistics generation is now dynamic as well! This changes nothing for users, but it means I no longer have to copy paste every single statistic, as they are generated directly in the right format into <a href="js/data.js">this file</a>. This means that data updates are now about three times faster than earlier.<br />
            <hr/><h5>29 Apr 2019:</h5>
            - Charts are now generated automatically (no inconsistent crop that varies between updates)<br />
            - Charts are now saved in SVG, which makes them zoomable and provides you with the raw data if you're willing to parse it<br />
            <hr/><h5>02 Jun 2018:</h5>
            - Graphs now have a higher size and resolution<br />

            - Added chart: top teams by score<br />
